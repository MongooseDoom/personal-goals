### Week in Review

Haflway through the week I had to redo my goals to accommodate finishing a workshop by the 27th. I'm doing a workshop on building Concrete5 blocks. I don't have a lot of time because of my trip so that needs to be the main focus next week.

I completed the PHP Development track on Treehouse. I enjoyed it and it certainly helped me understand what I've been doing in Concrete5 a bit more. I think my favorite part through was the Git stuff. I would like to use git more on a regular basis.

I finished Assassin's Quest and I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed it enough that I'm considering adding the rest of the trilogies to my To Read list. I just started The End of All Things and I'm hoping to finish it pretty quickly. I'm already a quarter of the way through.

Excited to relax next weekend!
