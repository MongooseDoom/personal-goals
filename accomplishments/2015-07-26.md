### Week in Review
I finished a book and did a workshop this week! Woo! I'm powering through the Farseer Trilogy and I'm already 25% of the way through the 3rd book. This is going to help a lot with my goodreads goal.

I failed pretty hard on the exercise part. I've had a hard time motivating myself to go to the gym even though I have an audiobook to listen to.
