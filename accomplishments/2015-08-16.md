### Week in Review

I had a great time at Universal Studios with Josh and Cate. All the new Harry Potter stuff was amazing and I got to spend time with two of my favorite people. I think one of my favorite moments was standing outside Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor while eating toffee and banana ice cream and hiding under the overhang while it rained in Diagon Alley. I'm glad we went but I'm sad I probably won't be back for quite a few years.

I grossly overestimated what I could get done the week before I left on vacation. I had way too much on my mind to finish my Concrete5 workshop so now I'm stuck finishing it on Tuesday and Wednesday this week. I'm going to keep it simple this week.
