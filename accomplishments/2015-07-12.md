### Week in Review
This is my first week doing this stuff. It definitely helped me power through the last of those database videos even though I'm seeing two movies a day. I commited to doing a workshop on the command line on the 30th so I'll spend one week learning as much as I can about it and the next week preparing.

The Asian Film Festival of Dallas is going on so it's going to be a rough week. Let's do this.
