### Week in Review
I exercised this week but let's be real here. What I did barely qualifies as exercise but I filled up the rings on my apple watch and that's a good enough place for me to start. I'm going to try to at least keep that up.

I did not finish the PHP Development Track this week. There were way more videos than I thought there would be. Next week it will be so! Since I'm ahead on my goal for learning stuff, I'm going to take some time to work on projects after I'm done with the PHP Track.
