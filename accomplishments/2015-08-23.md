### Week in Review

It was a short week this week because of vacation but I still got some good stuff done. I did my concrete5 workshop and if I'm being honest with myself, I didn't really like how I handled it. I want to work on keeping my workshops shorter. It's really tiring and probably really boring to listen to a 1 hour workshop. I also didn't rehearse my workshop nearly enough and that's not suprising because of my vacation. I have almost a whole month until my next one so I have plenty of time to make the next one better!

LET'S DO THIS!
