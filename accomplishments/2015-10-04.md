### Week in Review
This was my first week working through OSS and it went pretty well! I finished
Week 0 and started Week 1 of cs50. I'm enjoying it so far even though I already
know a lot of what they're going over. I learned how to count in binary and hex.
I also started my Arduino Workshop book but I got stuck because I didn't have the
resistors I needed :frowning:.

I got some pretty shitty news this week. It's something I expected but knowing
that it's a reality is really difficult. I need to take care of myself and go
after the things I want in life. It's more important now than ever.
